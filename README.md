# Data Mining Research 2016
In recent past, data mining has become one of the fastest growing and essential professional
field as there has been tremendous amount of data that needs to be processed and analyzed
in effective ways to make meaningful decisions. Algorithms varies in accuracy based on
the domains, shape, labels of data and etc. Thus the goal of our research is to investigate
how top data mining algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Expectation
Maximization and K-means perform in different datasets using R.
